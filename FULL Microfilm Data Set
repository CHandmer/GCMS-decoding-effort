Description of data set: The same data as on the mass spectra tapes are presented as bar graphs on 16-mm microfilm. 
Each frame contains one complete graph of the intensities of all masses detected. Because the lower masses (mostly CO2
and H2O) are predominant, a second graph starting at about mass 45 shows the heavy elements at a more appropriate scale. 
Graphs of engineering parameters are also included.
